Hello, I'm Gabriel Chiok. I'm the creator of this repo. The original goal of this guide is for me to put down all the information I learnt so that I can go back and retrieve it again. It's annoying to not know where you found this one source of information so this guide exists as a source of information. If this guide proves useful to you great. If not, oh well.



My images come from everywhere. If you have an issue with the image, just contact me and I will take it down and replace it with some other image. Same with the content. If you got some copyright or IP or whatever, tell me and I will remove it. I am just a collector of information.



Not much I need to say but enjoy and hope you can read my shitty English.
